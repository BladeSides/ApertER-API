## Pull request process

Once a pull request is submitted, it is reviewed by [AYESDIE](https://github.com/AYESDIE),
or a member of .asd to ensure that (if applicable):

 * the design meshes with the rest of aperter
 * any new functionality is tested and working

Once the pull request is approved, it may be merged between 3 and 7 days after approval.
This applies even if the submitter of the
PR is a member of the Contributors team.
